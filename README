Make sure FDT is installed to "/opt/fdt5/" and that the file permissions are set properly.

Save "fdt-icon.png" to the same folder as the FDT install directory, "/opt/fdt5/".
Save "fdt5" and "fdt5-clean" to "/usr/bin/" (may require admin rights)

If you want FDT to be available to all users on the computer, save "FDT5.desktop" (may hide the extension and show up as just plain "FDT5" if using Nautilus) to "/usr/share/applications/".

If you want FDT to only be available to the currently logged in user, save "FDT5.desktop" (may hide the extension and show up as just plain "FDT5" if using Nautilus) to "~/.local/share/applications/".
